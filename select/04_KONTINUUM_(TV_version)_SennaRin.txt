Lover
The stars circle around your head
Nations stoop to kiss the ground you walk on
Shiller!
Better a lie? Better I die? Better I make it stop?
Gravity shift, in the abyss, show me the shoe will drop
Could be I'm just a passing trend
You have to tune in 'cause it's not the end
Kill this destiny that's tryna to tell you what you should be
Into the void I scream
Someone try and stop me!
Check out my face
I got the look
Not gonna play by the book
This mic just got turned on
Make your decision
Dare to believe to become
To become
