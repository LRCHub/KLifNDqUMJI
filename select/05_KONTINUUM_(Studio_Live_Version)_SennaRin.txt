Lover
The stars circle around your head
Nations stoop to kiss the ground you walk on
Shiller!
Better a lie? Better I die? Better I make it stop?
Gravity shift, in the abyss, show me the shoe will drop
Could be I'm just a passing trend
You have to tune in 'cause it's not the end
Kill this destiny that's tryna to tell you what you should be
Into the void I scream
Someone try and stop me!
Check out my face
I got the look
Not gonna play by the book
This mic just got turned on
Make your decision
Dare to believe to become
To become

This star's future hangs by a thread
Am I strong enough?
To be continued
Chiller
Follow a key, follow a face, follow a clue from space
Evil 'n' good, deep in the wood, nobody left a trace
They left me on this cliff to die
My fingers slipping
It's my last goodbye
Kill this destiny that's tryna to tell you what you should be
Into the void I scream
Someone try and stop me!
Check out my face
I got the look
Not gonna play by the book
This mic just got turned on
Kill this destiny that's tryna to tell you what you should be
Into the void I scream
Someone try and stop me!
Check out my face
I got the look
Not gonna play by the book
This mic just got turned on
Make your decision
Dare to believe to become
