Deeper cover Spotlight lover
The stars circle
around your head
Nations stoop to kiss
the ground you walk on
Shiller!
Better a lie?
Better I die?
Better I make it stop?
Gravity shift In the abyss
Show me the shoe will drop
Could be I’m just
a passing trend
You have to tune in
cuz it’s not the end
Kill this destiny
that’s tryna tell you
what you should be
Into the void I scream
Someone try and stop me!
Check out my face
I got the look
Not gonna play by the book
This mic just got turned on
Make your decision
Dare to believe
to become to become

This star’s
future hangs by a thread
Am I strong enough?
To be continued
Chiller
Follow a key
Follow a face
Follow a clue from space
Evil ‘n’ good
Deep in the wood
Nobody left a trace
They left me
on this cliff to die
My fingers slipping
It’s my last goodbye
Kill this destiny
that’s tryna tell you
what you should be
Into the void I scream
Someone try and stop me!
Check out my face
I got the look
Not gonna play by the book
This mic just got turned on
Kill this destiny
that’s tryna tell you
what you should be
Into the void I scream
Someone try and stop me!
Check out my face
I got the look
Not gonna play by the book
This mic just got turned on
Make your decision
