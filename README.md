[00:01.79] Deeper cover
[00:07.23] Spotlight lover
[00:14.73] 
[00:11.89] The stars circle around your head
[00:16.32] Nations stoop to kiss the ground you walk on
[00:21.76] Shiller!
[00:23.06] Better a lie? Better I die? Better I make it stop?
[00:25.77] Gravity shift in the abyss
[00:27.12] Show me the shoe will drop
[00:28.66] Could be I'm just a passing trend
[00:31.33] You have to tune in 'cause it's not the end
[00:52.83] 
[00:38.02] Kill this destiny that's trying to tell you what you should be
[00:45.34] Into the void I scream
[00:48.11] Someone try and stop me!
[00:50.21] Check out my face
[00:51.92] I got the look
[00:53.72] Not gonna play by the book
[00:56.43] This mic just got turned on
[00:59.29] Make your decision
[01:08.29] 
[01:01.78] Dare to believe
[01:03.57] To become, to become
[01:06.45] Spotlight lover
[01:09.11] Deepest cover
[01:11.94] If you can dare to believe
[01:14.75] To become, to become
[01:17.57] Spotlight lover
[01:20.59] Deepest cover
[01:23.18] Spotlight
[01:27.68] 
[01:27.10] This star's future hangs by a thread
[01:31.79] Am I strong enough to be continued?
[01:37.07] Chiller!
[01:38.45] Follow a key, follow a face, follow a clue from space
[01:41.19] Evil and good
[01:41.99] Deep in the wood, nobody left a trace
[01:43.94] They left me on this cliff to die
[01:46.81] My fingers slipping, it's my last goodbye
[02:07.31] 
[01:53.47] Kill this destiny that's trying to tell you what you should be
[02:00.80] Into the void I scream
[02:03.38] Someone try and stop me!
[02:05.69] Check out my face
[02:07.35] I got the look
[02:09.30] Not gonna play by the book
[02:11.91] This mic just got turned on
[02:25.41] 
[02:15.79] Kill this destiny that's trying to tell you what you should be
[02:23.01] Into the void I scream
[02:25.82] Someone try and stop me!
[02:27.80] Check out my face
[02:29.84] I got the look
[02:31.46] Not gonna play by the book
[02:34.20] This mic just got turned on
[02:37.03] Make your decision
[02:46.03] 
[02:39.43] Dare to believe
[02:41.35] To become, to become
[02:44.12] Spotlight lover
[02:47.06] Deepest cover
[02:49.51] If you can dare to believe
[02:52.39] To become, to become
[02:55.35] Spotlight lover

[03:00.79] Spotlight
